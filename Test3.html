    <p>1. In a medium-sized saucepan, heat the chicken or vegetable broth over medium heat until it simmers. Keep the broth warm on low heat.</p>
    <p>2. In a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat until the butter is melted. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic and saut√© until the onion is translucent and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes.</p>
    <p>3. Add the Arborio rice to the pot and stir to coat with the butter and oil mixture. Continue stirring until the rice becomes slightly translucent around the edges, about 2-3 minutes.</p>
    <p>4. Pour in the white wine and stir until it is absorbed by the rice. Then, add a ladleful of warm broth to the pot and stir until it is absorbed by the rice. Repeat this process, adding one ladleful of broth at a time and stirring constantly until the rice is cooked through and the mixture is creamy, about 20-25 minutes.</p>
    <p>5. Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese and season with salt and black pepper to taste.</p>
    <p>6. Optional: If you want to add any optional ingredients such as chopped mushrooms or peas, add them at this stage and stir until heated through.</p>
    <p>7. Remove the pot from heat and let the risotto rest for a few minutes before serving. Serve hot with additional grated Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh herbs (optional) on top.</p>
