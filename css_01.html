        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics">CSS</a> stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
                <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
                <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
                <li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>

        <h2>CSS Demo - One HTML Page - Multiple Styles!</h2>
        <p>Here we will show one <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started">HTML page</a> displayed with four different stylesheets.</p> 
        <p>Click on the "Stylesheet 1", "Stylesheet 2", "Stylesheet 3", "Stylesheet 4" links below to see the different styles:</p>

        <h2>Why Use CSS?</h2>
        <p>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</p>   
            
        <h2>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h2>
        <p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!</p>
        <p>HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:</p>

        <hr>
        <h1>This is a heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers.</p>
        <p>Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.</p>
        <p>To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.</p>
        <p>CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>

        <h2>CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</h2>
        <p>The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.</p>
        <p>With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p>
