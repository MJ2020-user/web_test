    <p>1. In a large bowl, mix together soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger, black pepper, scallions, onions, and grated Asian pear (or substitute) to make the marinade.</p>
    <p>2. Add the thinly sliced beef to the bowl and stir to coat the meat evenly with the marinade. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight in the refrigerator.</p>
    <p>3. Heat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Add the marinated beef to the hot pan and cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side until browned and slightly crispy. You may need to cook the beef in batches.</p>
    <p>4. Serve hot with steamed rice and optional garnishes such as sesame seeds and sliced green onions.</p>
    <p>Note: Bulgogi can also be cooked on a grill or broiled in the oven.</p>
