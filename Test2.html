    <p>1/4 teaspoon of black pepper</p>

    <p>2 cups of vegetable oil (for frying)</p>
    <p><strong><u></u>For the sweet and sour sauce</u></strong></p>
    <p>1/2 cup of ketchup</p>
    <p>1/4 cup of rice vinegar</p>
    <p>1/4 cup of brown sugar</p>
    <p>2 tablespoons of soy sauce</p>
    <p>1 tablespoon of cornstarch</p>
    <p>1/2 cup of pineapple chunks (canned or fresh)</p>

    <p>1. In a shallow dish, mix together cornstarch, salt, and black pepper. Dip each piece of pork into the beaten egg, then coat with the cornstarch mixture.</p>
    <p>2. Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or deep skillet over high heat until hot. Add the coated pork pieces in small batches and fry until golden brown and crispy, about 3-5 minutes per batch. Remove the pork with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</p>
    <p>3. In a separate bowl, whisk together ketchup, rice vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, and cornstarch until smooth. Set aside.</p>
    <p>4. Drain the oil from the wok, leaving only about 1 tablespoon. Add the chopped bell peppers and onions and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until they are slightly softened.</p>
    <p>5. Add the pineapple chunks and stir-fry for another minute. Pour in the sweet and sour sauce and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly until the sauce thickens.</p>
    <p>6. Add the fried pork pieces to the wok and stir to coat with the sauce. Cook for another minute or until the pork is heated through.</p>
    <p>7. Serve hot with steamed rice and optional garnishes such as sliced scallions and sesame seeds.</p>
